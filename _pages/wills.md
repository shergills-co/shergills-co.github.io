### The Importance of Making a Will

People very often imagine that that all they need do to make a will is write down a piece of paper with what they want and to sign and date it. Nothing could be further from the truth. The formalities involved in making a will are very technical and they can, and do, frequently trip up amateur will-makers. The results of apparently simple mistakes can lead to costly litigation which can very easily be avoided when the will is originally drafted. These are by means the only formalities attending the making of a will and, indeed, the necessary formalities can vary according to the circumstances.
 
There are also rules about beneficiaries and spouses of beneficiaries acting as witnesses to the will. All in all, the process is by no means straightforward and it is a very foolhardy person who relies upon a homemade will. Incidentally, it is approximately only one adult in three who has a will which is a surprisingly low figure considering the benefits that a will can provide at normally very modest cost. At Shergill & Co. we have the experience to handle all that you may require.
 
Whether these formalities should be so technical is, of course, debatable but so long as they exist it is sensible to have any will professionally drawn up and not to attempt to do it yourself. One such formality is laid down by section 9 of the Wills Act 1837 and it will give a flavour of what is involved: "No will shall be valid unless:
- it is in writing, and signed by the testator, or by some other person in his presence and by his direction;
- and it appears that the testator intended by his signature to give effect to the will; and
- the signature is made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time; and
- each witness either - (i) attests and signs the will; or (ii) acknowledges his signature, in the presence of the testator (but not necessarily in the presence of any other witness), but no form of attestation shall be necessary."

### Costs and timescales
We anticipate this will take between 8 and 12 hours work at £250.00 per hour. Total costs estimated at -£1,500 - £2,500 +VAT. (*VAT is charged at the current rate of 20%). The exact cost will depend on the individual circumstances of the matter. For example, if there is one beneficiary and no property, costs will be at the lower end of the range. If there are multiple beneficiaries, a property and multiple bank accounts, costs will be at the higher end.
We will handle the full process for you. This estimate is for estates where:
- There is a valid will
- There is no more than one property
- There are no more than 4 bank or building society accounts
- There are no other intangible assets
- There are 1-4 beneficiaries
- There are no disputes between beneficiaries on division of assets. If disputes arise this is likely to lead to an increase in costs
- There is no inheritance tax payable and the executors do not need to submit a full account to HMRC
- There are no claims made against the estate
Disbursements to be added to this fee:
Disbursements are costs related to your matter that are payable to third parties, such as court fees. We handle the payment of the disbursements on your behalf to ensure a smoother process
- Probate application fee of £155.00 + £1 per office copy.
- £7 - Swearing of the oath (per executor)
- £2 - Bankruptcy - only Land Charges Department searches
- £180 approximately - Post in The London Gazette and a Local Newspaper.
Potential additional costs
- If there is no will or the estate consists of any share holdings (stocks and bonds) there are likely to be additional costs that could range significantly depending on the estate and how it is to be dealt with. We can give you a more accurate estimate once we have more information.
- Dealing with the sale or transfer of any property in the estate is not included.
On average, estates that fall within this range are dealt with within 4-8 months. Typically, obtaining the Grant of Probate takes 8-12 weeks. Collecting assets then follows, which can take between 2-4 weeks. Once this has been done, we can distribute the assets, which normally takes a further 2-4 weeks.
